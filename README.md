# blocks-of-snn
fundamental building blocks of spiking neural network
In the blocks_of_snn folder, there are three memristor models, eg_memristor.py, hp_memristor.py and tb_memristor.py, and three neuron models, hr_neuron.py, iz_neuron.py and lif_neuron.py. 
iz_eg_iz_sum.py, lif_eg_lif_sum.py and lif_tb_lif_sum.py are the basic structures of neuron-synapse-neuron spiking neural network. 
The hp_memristor_nolinear folder is an hp memristor model composed of an improved nonlinear look-up table.
